# Introduction
Welcome to our session today which is about Cloud Computing.

The goals for today are to:
1. Explain what cloud computing is and how it can be useful.
2. Give ~~two~~ three demos including one where we speed up some Blender renders.

## Before Cloud Computing
* As far back as the 60s, "time sharing" / client-server models show how computing advances are often costly / unevenly distributed; model changed in the 80s/90s when cheap **microcomputers** become ubiquitous.
* In the 90s/2000s people / companies had to manage their own **on prem** infrastructure.
* Only those who could still afford **mainframes** could perform/offer compute-heavy services.

## Definitions Please!
According to International Organization for Standards (ISO) [there are 5 key factors](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf):
1. **On-demand self service:** unilateral and without human interaction.
2. **Broad network access:** Available everywhere, not just corporate / home LANs.
3. **Resource pooling:** Provider's resources are pooled and shared.
4. **Rapid elasticity:** rapid provisioning and releasing; can appear unlimited.
5. **Measured service:** access to resources is monitored, logged and billed.

## Advantages
In a way, cloud computing is kind of a return to that older model from the 60s and 70s, putting the power of 'big iron' or mainframes into the hands of anyone who's got a few bucks (or a few thousand).

* Available everywhere, always on
* It's someone else's problem to make sure the infrastructure is working
* Flexible / Scalable: CPU / RAM / GPUs on demand etc etc
* Maintenance, power included
* Ability to rent a globally available IP
* Costs: renting a super computer for a short burst or renting a small instance for months/years
* [Scriptibility](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
* 'remote terminals' can be lightweight, fanless, and or have batteries last for hours


## Disadvantages
* There is no cloud...
	![There is no cloud; it's just someone else's computer](/2024/files/no_cloud.jpeg)
* "Cost"
	* Did you shut it off?!
	* [Is cloud computing actually cheaper?](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335678/why-exit-the-cloud-37signals-explains.html)
* Locality and Latency:
	![Map of AWS zones](/2024/files/aws_zones.png)
* More concerns around security
	* Must trust provider
    * Public IPs?  Firewall?
    * Sharing hardware with other people!
		* most 'instances' are a part of a larger computer!
* Lots more details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_issues)


## Use Cases

![Astral Projection](/2024/files/astral_ssh.jpg)

Cloud Computing is often pitched at big companies but the key point of this talk is that **there's no reason you can't use them for your own personal projects or assignments** (though you should never NEED to use a paid service for your coursework!).  It's nice to know it's possible to access this power / hardware on a temporary basis and that's why we're covering it in Missing Semester.

Here are a few uses for cloud computing that might be more relevant to students:

* Hosting services eg:
	* Websites, databases
* Number crunching eg:
	* Rendering
	* Compiling
	* ML Training
* The whole [self hosting](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) universe
	* Make your own VPN
	* Git servers
	* Nextcloud
	* Mastodon instance
* [Cloudy gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudygamer/)
* Testing software
	* ARM and Mac OS instances

## So how does this all work?
We're going to be demonstrating the concepts above via Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) but first a few notes:

1. This is *not* an advertisement for Amazon!  Many other cloud providers (Google, [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/)) exist.  Amazon's is just the oldest and the one I'm most comfortable with.
2. The interface for AWS is a bit hairy; there might be simpler solutions out there!
3. We're mostly going to be talking about rentable virtual computers with EC2.  However, EC2 is only a part of 'cloud computing' / Amazon Web Services (AWS); AWS has over 200 other services including EBS, S3, Lambda (serverless), Cloudfront, etc etc.
4. We're going to be working with 64-bit x86 linux instances but you can also create instances for other OSes / architectures including Windows.

### Instance Types
Anyway, EC2 (and others) have a [few different types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) of computers to rent:
* **General Purpose:** eg A1, T3, T2, M5, M5a, M4, T3a
* **Compute Optimized:** eg C5, C5n, C4
* **Memory Optimized:** eg R5, R5a, R4, X1e, X1, High Memory, z1d
* **Accelerated Computing:** eg P3, P2, G3, F1
* **Storage Optimized:** eg H1, I3, D2

### Pricing

<div class="note">
These pictures are from Missing Semester 2024; these prices have probably come down since!
</div>

* On demand pricing
	* Remember: ~720 hours in a month
	* But also "bursts"
	* page 1 of 27:
	![EC2 Pricing; page 1 of 27](/2024/files/ec2_pricing.png)
* Savings plan -- probably not super relevant to us
* Spot Instances
* Free Tiers:

<div class="note">
Remember: if something is persisting, you're probably paying for it.

# Demo Time!
Lets explore two use cases together!

## Demo 1: Micro Instance
* You can follow [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html) to get a low-spec machine running on a free tier
* Stick with free tier eligible stuff!
* You'll need:
	* An Image (or AMI): Amazon Linux is fine
	* A desired instance type: smallest is okay
	* A key pair
	* A network
	* A **security group**: ssh + web ports
	* An EBS volume: 8GB is fine.
* If all goes well you'll be at a remote terminal now!
* Now you're at a terminal interface on a machine potentially in another country.  Good think you've been coming to Missing Semester!
	```
	$ echo "Hello Missing Semester" > index.html
	$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80 # default is 8000
	```
* Copy the public IP address of the server once more
* Now visit `http://$IP` in your web browser!
* This sort of instance would be perfect for some low-power server software you might want to run or experiment with.


## Demo 2: Rendering

![Blender splash screen White Lands](/2024/files/white_lands_small.jpg)

Blender is FOSS 3D modeling and animation software.  Whenever they release a new version, there is a new splash screen.  The scenefiles that were used to make these splash screens are distributed on blender's website as a good example of a self-contained complex scene.

Lets try to render the Blender 3.2 splash screen image, White Lands, by [Oksana Dobrovolska](https://www.artstation.com/dabrosha).

* Also, let me show you how slow this is on my laptop!
	* Estimate: roughly an hour and a half.
* EC2 Settings:
    * Name: blender-demo
	* AMI: debian
	* Instance type: c5.4xlarge
    * key-pair: same for now
    * Security Group: something with ssh access (we'll 'forget' to include rdp)
	* 30GB drive
* A note about Quotas; might need to request access in advance!
	* Quotas are good actually
* Connect with something like: `ssh -i keypair.pem ubuntu@18.168.154.102`
* Then:
``` bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y xfce4 xrdp htop
$ sudo adduser demoguest # set password to, eg, "demo"
$ su - demouser
$ wget https://download.blender.org/demo-files/splash-screens/blender-3-2/blender-splash-3-2-v2-640d7b753da44f1a8c9629209b46305a.blend
$ wget https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/blender/release/Blender5.0/blender-5.0.1-linux-x64.tar.xz
$ tar -xf blender-5.0.1-linux-x64.tar.xz
```
* Edit the security group to include RDP access
* Connect with an rdp client, open the file in blender, and start rendering!
* This kind of setup is sometimes called VDI -- Virtual Desktop Infrastructure


## Demo 3: Rendering w/ GPU acceleration

We probably don't have time to demo this but I was able to rent a third machine with GPU hardware.

* Same settings as above except:
	* Instance type: g5.xlarge
    * Security Group: ssh access only

* Then:
``` bash
$ sudo apt update
# update apt sources to include "main contrib non-free non-free-firmware"
$ sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential dkms nvidia-detect
$ sudo apt install nvidia-driver nvidia-kernel-dkms
# reboot computer
$ nvidia-smi # should now give some output, detecting GPU
$ sudo apt install -y htop
$ sudo adduser demoguest # set password to, eg, "demo"
$ su - demouser
$ wget https://download.blender.org/demo-files/splash-screens/blender-3-2/blender-splash-3-2-v2-640d7b753da44f1a8c9629209b46305a.blend
$ wget https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/blender/release/Blender5.0/blender-5.0.1-linux-x64.tar.xz
$ tar -xf blender-5.0.1-linux-x64.tar.xz
```

* No need to setup a graphical session here -- we can render headlessly:
```bash
# CPU only
$ ./blender-5.0.1-linux-x64/blender -b blender-splash-3-2-v2-640d7b753da44f1a8c9629209b46305a.blend -f 1 -- --cycles-device CPU
# GPU only
$ ./blender-5.0.1-linux-x64/blender -b blender-splash-3-2-v2-640d7b753da44f1a8c9629209b46305a.blend -f 1 -- --cycles-device CUDA
# CPU+GPU
$ ./blender-5.0.1-linux-x64/blender -b blender-splash-3-2-v2-640d7b753da44f1a8c9629209b46305a.blend -f 1 -- --cycles-device CUDA+CPU
```

* Check out these Rendertimes in GPU-only mode; the render finishes in 2 minutes and 20 seconds, about a 60x speedup from my laptop.

* Left as an exercise to the reader to retrieve any locally rendered files back (hint: look at the `scp` command)

# Final Reminder:
<div class="note">
<strong>Please</strong> remember to turn off your instances and any EBS volumes you're not using!
<br><br>
Also note that terminated instances will stick around in interface for a bit...
</div>

Otherwise, have fun!
